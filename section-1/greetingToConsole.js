// Challenge:
// Create two variables, name and greeting. The name variable should store your name,
// and the greeting should store e.g. "Hi, my name is "
// Create a third variable, myGreeting, that concatenates the two strings.
// Log myGreeting to the console.

let name = "Hannah";
let greeting = "Hi, my name is ";
let myGreeting = greeting + name;
console.log(myGreeting);

// in a wrestling game, the string always wins on the number
let points = 4;
let bonusPoints = "10"

let totalPoints = points + bonusPoints;
console.log(totalPoints); // This will show us 410;

// Exercise:
// Think about the solutions of these console.log()s
console.log(4 + 5); // 9, because they are both numbers
console.log("2" + "4"); // "24", because they are both strings
console.log("5" + 1); // "51", because 1 gets converted into a string (string always wins)
console.log(100 + "100"); // "100100", because 100 gets converted into a string.
