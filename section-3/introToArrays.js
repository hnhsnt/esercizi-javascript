// Arrays - ordered lists of items

// Arrays are zero indexed. You grab the first item starting from 0 and not from 1.

let featuredPosts = [
    "Check out my Netflix clone",       // 0
    "Here's the code for my project",   // 1
    "I've just relaunched my portfolio" // 2
];


// Challenge:
// Create an array that lists your i.e. experience, education, licenses, skills or similar
// The items of the array should be strings

let skills = [
    "Coding",
    "Cooking",
    "Baking",
    "Playing the piano",
    "Playing the guitar",
];
